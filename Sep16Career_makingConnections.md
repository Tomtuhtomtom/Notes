## Making connections on LinkedIn
double check your connections, they may have left their job and joined the company you are tracking

Find emails and add them to your LAMP list, hunter.io is one way to find emails

In the notes you send to new connections that you don't know, say something in the first few words to help them know you're not spam, Momentum alum, etc. that they can make the connections

## Outreach Email
keep fewer than 100 words, don't mention asking for a job, focus on asking about their experience and keep it general.  Just show you are interested in the company.  Acknowledge that they are busy, you can say that you'll contact them again later(kinda warn them that you will keep bothering them if they don't respond, ha)

Katie has several templates for different scenarios, job posting interest, interview advice..

__Use the 3B7 follow-up method__
after 3 days, reach out to more people in the company
after 7 days, follow up with the original contacts

_you have to ask twice_

_Respond within 24 hours to anyone that responds_

## Information Interviews

inviting people for coffee/etc. to get to know them, ask about company

__Do your research__
Look at their linkedIn, have some knowledge of them
Find about the company so you can stay in the conversation
Have an agenda, don't waste their time
__Once the meet is setup__
Greet
Thank
Show what value to the talk you bring
describe your agenda

__Game Plan__
Ask open ended questions, keep them talking
Ask about TIARA
__T__ rends - trends in company/business world
__I__ nsights - best lessons they've learned
__A__ dvice - here's my plan-does this make sense?
__R__ esources - blogs? podcasts they follow?
__A__ ssignments - favorite project they worked on?

What 3 things do you want them to remember about you?  Keep them talking but have things to share to be remembered

What things do you have to share? Resourses, connections?

End the meeting on time, take notes and follow up
If they offered something in the meeting, maybe an introduction to someone, remind them at the end of the interview
