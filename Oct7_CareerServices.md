## STARR Method
__S__ ituation 
Brief description to give context
__T__ ask
Describe the task you were doing
__A__ ction
Talk about the actions that you did
__R__ esult
Tell the interviewer exactly what the result was
__R__ eflection
Upon reflection, what did you learn from those things

When asked those 'tell me about a time' questions in interviews is a good time to use the STARR method

Example:
What obstacles have you run into in a software development project and how did you handle that?

The example is the one filled out in the spreadsheet Katie shared

Tell me about a time when you failed
They are looking for resilance
Did you learn from your mistakes

S - Mention where you were working and the failure
T - Tell them how you took responsibility
A - Tell them what you did to make it right
R - Tell them what changes you made to how you work in response to the incident to make sure it won't happen again
R - Tell them what you learned from this situation

STARR is not a Momentum thing, many companies suggest using it when answering their interview questions

__How to _Ask_ Good Questions__
why ask questions:
you need to leave the interview with a really good understanding of what the job entails
This is your opportunity to demonstrate that you:
    Are really interested in the position
    Come to meetings prepared / do your homework
    Are a good listener
    Are curious
_Don't ask just to ask, don't ask simple google search questions_

__Strategy for Questions__
Start with questions about the position
take notes during the interview - if it's virtual, it's easy to have a notepad
Examples:
If I were to exceed your expectations in this role, what would I do? (things that would be exceptional?)
Deck will be available

Ask questions about the bigger picture
Do research about the company, what are the companies biggest challenges?

End with questions about the next steps
When are you hoping to start someone in this role?
__Can I please have your email address so I can follow up with you?__

Softball questions that work
What's your favorite part about your job/company?
How is this company different from other companies you've worked at previously?
Where do you think the company is headed in the next 5 years?
How has the team stayed connected while working from home?
What's the best lesson you've learned on the job here?

__You are interviewing them too!__
Reverse interview sample questions
company culture/values, scope of role, etc.

Deck will have a list of questions to ask your interviewer based on those categories

__After the Interview__
Do a debrief
general reflections
preparation
mental preparedness
successes
challenges
changes I will make

__Following up is critical!__
within 24 hours, write a small brief email to all people that interviewed you.  it's common courtesy!

Only 5-10% of people wrote thank you notes when asking a local recruiter, easy way to stand out

__Before the Interview__
How many interviews should job seekers have to sit through? 2 or 3 is expected

PRE interview checklist
Research the company and the people who will be interviewing you, history, size, business model, products, check linkedin
Practice questions and prepare answers, practice with friends/family, do it outloud
Prepare questions, what do you want to know, time to shine
Have your voicemail setup
Be prepared for a virtual interview, have your resume on hand, pull up your portfolio and github, have notes but out of site
Dress the part, professional and comfortable-err on the side of being overdressed
Get in a good head space, be present and engaged, build confidence - power pose, check out Amy Cuddy's TED talk

Virtual interview: Video
Initial 30 minute virtual converstion, make sure you know if it's phone or video
make sure audio, video, internet, battery is all good
pick a distraction free background - check what is behind you
well lit
speak to the camera not to the screen, eye contact
Be enthusiastic

Don't worry if you answer one question badly, just move on
don't answer just yes or no, they are open ended
don't talk negatively about past experiences
don't lie
don't be afraid to ask for clarification
