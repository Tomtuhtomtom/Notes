## TIME MANAGEMENT
goals are good but systems make them happy

__build habits__ - start small - one paragraph a day and build on it

8 focused hours are better then 10 long unorganized hours

__Focus__ when it's time to work, close the computer and leave your workspace when work is over

Be careful about checking email first - if you need it to be up to date ok but it can make you focus on other peoples needs instead of your own

Yuriy shared a good tip in the chat - work slippers and chill slippers

__Organize work space and minimize distractions__ - turn off the phones but schedule times for those things so you can stay focused and feel like you'll still be able to do things you enjoy

Write down goals - writing them down helps set them in stone - reminding yourself about your goals helps keep you focused and on track

__Have a schedule__, try time blocking, one solid block focused on one thing is better than bouncing around, schedule your lunch

If you work from home, it's good to schedule things to replenish yourself that are outside of your house

__Don't stay stuck - Ask for help__
give yourself an amount of time before you ask

__Estimating time for deadlines__
Build a cushion - under promis and over deliver when you're new

Track how long tasks take so you can make better estimates

Be a good teammate and communicate your progress-bad news is best delivered early

Speak up if you're at risk of missing a deadline

__Stop Procrastinating__
Getting started is the hardest part
Commit to working on a project-if it helps-make a small goal just to get started
Reward yourself - make the things you want to do the reward for getting started

__Eat the frog__
Consider doing the worst part first so you know that the hard part is done and your day can only get better

__Get a body double tip__
sit with someone who is also working, it will help you be in work mode
