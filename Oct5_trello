### Trello
tasks begin with user stories
"As a [type of user], I want to [do something], so that [some reason]."
    Try to see the app from the user perspective
    What specifically does the user need or want?
    This is the WHY. Why is this feature necessary? What value does it add?

__Turn user stories into tasks__

__Tasks are small and precise__
A task should be small enough to be done in a single day.  If it's too big, break it down further.

__One task == one Trello card__
clear heading that states the task
labelled(FE, sidebar, high priority, etc.)
initially unassigned
can have more info on the inside(desc, links, comments)
can be prioritized
has a clear definition of done
any developer on the team can assign the card/task themselves and work on it

__create a checklist for a task__
