## Cover Letters
poll on linkedin showed that only 35% of hiring managers said they read them, 32% said they never read them

Not providing a cover letter tells them that you're not that interested so definitely write one

__Goal of a cover letter__
Describe why you're a great fit for the role
Help you stand out as a candidate
Provide the missing pieces that resumes don't provide

__What makes a cover letter strong__
Brief and easy to read
Personal - personalized to the company/role
Follows a logical order (flow)
Grammatically perfect!
Has an intro, body and a closing
Addressed to a specific person when possible

__Start with the job description__
LinkedIn job description example
Title :_Entry to Jr-level Full Stack Java Software Development Engineer_
Poster: _Andy Rucker_
Title shows that the company is trying to get a lot of hits
Has a person so we can write our letter straight to them

__Highlight Key words and phrases__
"energetic product development team", "entrepreneurial"

_*tip-don't worry about Bachelor's degree in CS requirement-usually a default-people writing these descriptions are just trying to get it done and write what the perfect candidate would be_

Companies are more interested in skills not degrees/certifications

LinkenIn provides a "How you match" which helps identify the key words/skills

__Cover letter example__
Hi Andy, is okay, Dear Mr whatever is not necessary any more
Use the key words and talk about how excited you are
Example has a bullitted list with key words in bold and explains how you have those skills
In the last conclusion line, I look foward to...

You're not limited to just technical skills, if it's relevant and brief, include it, customer service skills etc.

__Tips__
Use thier language-steal it from job description
Demonstrate what you know about the company
Reference connections-name drop
Save your cover letters in a way that you can find it easy for reference

__Job Applications__
Customize your resume(skill list, profile, relevant work)
Balance between customizing and re-doing the resume for every job
LinkedIn Easy Apply - resume loaded to LinkedIn but not necessarily pushed to the company so may need to do both
Quality over quantity - 200 applications isn't as good as 20 solid applications
Save the job descriptions - if they take the job down you still have the description to prepare for interviews
Track your activity on your LAMP list

__Finding the Right Roles__
Entry level listings often ask for 3+ years experience, rarely is there jobs that require 0 experience
Think broadly about what constitutes "experience" why Momentum goes in Experience section in your resume
Apply anyway, don't worry about it

What is expected salary range?
Advice options for Jr Software Developer in Raleigh:
Plan A: range of $70,000 to $80,000
Plan B: $75,000
Plan C: leave blank
Adjust higher for a big company
Goal is just to be in the ballpark
If you set the range low, you can always re-negotiate after you 'learned more about the role and the market valve for the role'
Average Momentum grads in this area: $73K and change
If you say to low, then companies may think you don't actually have software skills because you don't know what it's worth
