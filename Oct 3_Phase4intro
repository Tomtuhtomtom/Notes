## Phase 4!
__First part: schedule, Q & A__
first thing is to plan, no coding for a couple of days

__Agile__
Waterfall development:
Step by step method
Old way that Agile creators were using and getting frustrated with

They got together and wrote the Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

__Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools

__Working software__ over comprehensive documentation

__Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation

__Responding to change__ over following a plan

 That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

 Agile is a cycle instead of step by step

 __Agile concepts__

    define software from the user perspective
    work in short cycles
    daily meetings(standups)
    get something minimal working quickly
    frequently release improvements on the original version
    get feedback often
    change the plan if needed

__The Players__
    Stakeholders: business people, often non-technical, who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project, the money
    Product Owner: Represents the business(stakeholder) point of view to the teams and knows what the goal is, the eyes and ears for the stakeholders
    Team: A group of professionals working together produce a product(developers, designers, UI/UX people, OA testers, dev ops)

__MVP__
Minimum viable product:
The simplest functional version of the product

__Sprint__
A time-limited, single cycle(or iteration) of the development process of a gixed, short length. Two weeks sprints are common

__Backlog__
A collection of tasks and stories to be completed in a given sprint or over several sprints.
Developers choose, or are assigned, tasks from this list to work on.

__Story aka User Story__
A basic unit of the development process that describes a single aspect of the product.
Expressing it this way allows for clear communication and planning among both the technical and non-technical people involved.
A user story explains __what__ is being built, __why__ it is being built and __the product goal__ it fulfilles

As a <type of user> I want to <> so that<>

__"type of user"__
Stories from Momentum creating the self-evaluations:

As a student user, I want to see the results of all my past evaluations so that I can measure my progess.

As an instructor user, I want to schedule an evaluation so that it can be completed by students.

__Task and Task Board__
A small thing. 
A visual representation of tasks(like Trello) used to organize a team's work by using categories to represent a stage in the process.
A minimal structure would include 3 categories:
to do, in progress, done

__Standup__
A brief, daily team meeting in which story or task progress is discussed.  Each person has a turn to speak and addresses the following:
What they have done since yesterday
What they are planning to do today
What obstacles are blocking their progress("blockers")
