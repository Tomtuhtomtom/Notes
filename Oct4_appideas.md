## Team 13 joined in to share thoughts
__Team Pumpkin Ideas__
Corey: Codenames
Alexis: AR models
Stephen: What to do
Tom: NeighBorrow

People enjoyed the idea of a game and wondered if there is a way to combine ideas

__Breakout Room__
NeighBorrow sounds like the one we might do

Ideas for it:
Categories
Rating system? Stars/Thumbs up
HOA controls as admin
Before and After pictures?
Keep it specific, don't make Nextdoor
Seasonal themes
